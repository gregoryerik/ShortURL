# ShortURL
URL to ShortURL using Flask and MongoDB

## This program will not run without the hidden folder and hidden JSON file

Create a hidden folder (in the main dir) with 'hidden-json.json' file inside.

Template for file:
```
  {
    "database-precursor": "mongodb+srv://",
    "database-suffix": "@****-*****.azure.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&ssl=true&ssl_cert_reqs=CERT_NONE",
    "database-username": "********",
    "database-password": "********",
    "code-length": 4
}
```
This requires a MONGODB database in Atlas

## MongoDB

As this is a small micro example of a URL shortner, there are only 4 fields in each document (each document averages 111 bytes). The fields are as follows:

- _id -> Auto generated by Mongodb
- expiry_date -> allows for a cleanup program to be written which removes expired documents.
- full_url -> where the short url will redirtect to
- url_code -> 4 character (can be more but defaults to 4 - see code) code which is used in the url of this site

I could have added additional data such as user authentication but this was created as a day challenge, not to be used seriousl
